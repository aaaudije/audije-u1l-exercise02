Steps on how to create GitHub page
  1. Make sure that the project you have (HTML, CSS, or any other files) are all set.
  2. Head over to GitHub and create a new repository (or if you have one already, use that).
  3. Push your code to GitHub using 'git add', 'git commit', and 'git push'.
  4. Go to your repository's settings then scroll down until you find the "Pages" section. Select your main branch as the source.
  5. Once it's done, you'll see a notification telling you that your site is live and you're done!
What are your key takeaways from this exercise?
  Creating a web page involves designing and coding your content using HTML and CSS. With HTML, you structure the bones of your webpage,
  while CSS adds the vibrant colors and elegant designs that bring it to life. With GitHub, sharing your creation with the world is as
  easy as pushing your code to a repository and flipping the switch to enable GitHub Pages.
